# Mapping EFH rasters to Atlantis GOA

This code maps EFH rasters for ontogenetic distributions of GOA and AI groundfish species to the model geometry of Atlantis GOA. It entails merging the AI and GOA rasters, which may not be appropriate and requires review if used to evaluate the Western edge of the Atlantis domain. 

This is useful for validation of the `sdmTMB` approach.
